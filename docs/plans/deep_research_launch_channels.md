# Deep Research Prompt: Launch Channels & Aggregators

**Find all relevant channels, directories, and aggregators to announce the launch of an open source product**

I'm launching **Mapsurvey** — an open source (AGPLv3) self-hostable geospatial survey platform built with Django + PostGIS. It lets urban planners, researchers, and civic tech teams create location-based surveys where respondents draw points, lines, and polygons on interactive maps. There's also a paid cloud version at mapsurvey.org.

Key characteristics of the product:
- Open source, self-hostable (Docker)
- PPGIS (Public Participation GIS) tool
- Alternative to Maptionnaire (~$3,000/year) and Social Pinpoint
- Built with Django, PostGIS, Leaflet, HTMX
- Target audience: urban planners, municipal governments, research institutions, civic tech organizations, planning consultancies

**I need a comprehensive, categorized list of every relevant place where I should announce this launch.** For each resource, provide: name, URL, audience size (if known), format of submission (post, listing, email pitch, etc.), and any tips for maximizing impact.

Please cover ALL of the following categories:

## 1. Launch platforms & aggregators
Product Hunt, Hacker News (Show HN), and any other product launch platforms or "new tool" aggregators relevant for developer tools, open source, or GIS software.

## 2. Reddit communities
All relevant subreddits — not just the obvious ones like r/opensource and r/gis. Include niche communities for urban planning, civic tech, self-hosted software, Django, mapping, survey tools, data collection, local government, etc.

## 3. Open source directories & catalogs
Sites that list and catalog open source projects — like awesome-selfhosted, AlternativeTo, LibHunt, Open Source Alternatives, etc. Include any GIS-specific or civic-tech-specific directories.

## 4. GIS & geospatial communities
Forums, mailing lists, Slack/Discord servers, professional networks specific to GIS, geospatial technology, and mapping. Include OSGeo, QGIS community, GeoNet, Mapbox community, PostGIS community, etc.

## 5. Civic tech & gov tech communities
Where civic technologists, gov tech professionals, and public participation practitioners gather — Code for America network, mySociety, Open Government communities, participatory budgeting networks, etc.

## 6. Urban planning & research communities
Professional forums, academic mailing lists, LinkedIn groups, and associations for urban planners, transportation planners, environmental planners, and researchers who use PPGIS or community engagement tools.

## 7. Developer communities & forums
Dev.to, Hashnode, Lobsters, Indie Hackers, and other developer-oriented platforms. Include Python/Django-specific communities, self-hosted enthusiast communities (r/selfhosted, Awesome-Selfhosted), and DevOps/Docker communities.

## 8. Newsletters & curated lists
Newsletters that feature new open source projects, developer tools, or GIS/civic-tech products. Include both general (TLDR, Console.dev, Changelog) and niche (GIS-focused, planning-focused) newsletters.

## 9. Social media strategy
Best LinkedIn groups, Twitter/X accounts and hashtags, Mastodon instances, and other social platforms relevant to the GIS / civic tech / open source intersection.

## 10. Press & media outlets
Journalists, bloggers, publications, and podcasts that cover: open source software, GIS technology, gov tech / civic tech, urban planning technology. Include both mainstream tech media and niche industry publications (Directions Magazine, Geospatial World, The New Stack, GovTech Magazine, etc.).

## 11. Conferences & events (for CFP submissions or virtual booths)
Upcoming conferences in 2025-2026 where this product would be relevant — FOSS4G, State of the Map, APA conferences, Code for America Summit, etc.

## 12. Academic & research channels
How to reach researchers who use PPGIS tools — ResearchGate groups, academic mailing lists, university GIS program networks, relevant journals that accept software papers.

## 13. Comparison & review sites
G2, Capterra, SourceForge, and any other software review/comparison sites where we should create a listing.

## 14. Package/tool registries
Docker Hub, PyPI (if applicable), GitHub Topics/Collections, and any other registries where listing would improve discoverability.

## 15. International / non-English channels
Key non-English communities for GIS, civic tech, and open source — particularly in Europe (where PPGIS adoption is high), Latin America, and Asia.

For each item, prioritize by estimated impact and effort. Flag any channels that have specific submission rules or timing requirements (e.g., Product Hunt launches best on Tuesday-Thursday).
